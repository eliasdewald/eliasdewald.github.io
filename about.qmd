# Hometown - Half Moon Bay, CA

![](media/HMB.png){height="3in"}

I'm from a small town about thirty minutes south of San Francisco called Half Moon Bay. It is a truly beautiful place as it is sandwiched between the Pacific Ocean on one side and mountains on the other side, much like Santa Barbara. Growing up there cemented my love for the outdoors, and especially the mountains and the sea.

# Favorite Plants

Over the past few years, I've really grown to appreciate the plants around me. I've always liked plants, but I enjoy being in there company more now and have a few local favorites.

### 1. *Juncus bufonius* - Common toad rush

I love their rusty colored flowers, especially during the drier parts of the year when they begin to pop more due to the color contrast with the rest of their structure.

### 2. *Centromadia parryi spp. australis* - Southern tarplant

I like how spiky these plants are and their small yellow flowers. Also a California Rare Plant Rank: 1B.1 which I find pretty neat. Took this photo on 05/28/2025!

### 2. *Artemesia californica* - California sagebrush

I'm a big fan of the smell of these plants. Always a treat to run my hands through one and get a whiff of their scent.
