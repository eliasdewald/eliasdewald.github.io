    "text": "Hello! My name is Eli and I’m a 3rd year Environmental Studies student at the University of California Santa Barbara and a student worker for the UCSB Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration. I enjoy doing restoration work, working with plants, and learning and implementing strategies to ensure the success of projects. Outside of work, I love surfing, hiking, cooking, socializing, and again, plants. Check out the rest of my website to learn more about me!"

    "text": "Hometown - Half Moon Bay, CA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m from a small town about thirty minutes south of San Francisco called Half Moon Bay. It is a truly beautiful place as it is sandwiched between the Pacific Ocean on one side and the Santa Cruz mountains on the other side, so similar to how it is here in Santa Barbara. Growing up there cemented my love for the outdoors, especially the mountains and the sea.\n\n\nEducation\nI’m currently in the spring quarter of my 3rd year studying Environmental Studies at UCSB. I am pursuing a Bachelor’s of Science, so I’ve been taking many science classes during my time here. Of the sciences, ecology is the subject I’ve found most interesting. I specifically enjoy topics like ecological restoration and management, as well as community ecology, plant ecology, and fire ecology. Additionally, I’ve liked learning how to use tools like RStudio and ArcGIS Pro to help analyze and visualize data within these fields.\n\n\nFavorite Plants\nOver the past few years, I’ve really grown to appreciate the plants around me. I’ve always liked plants, but I enjoy being in there company more now. I also have a few local favorites.\n\n1. Juncus bufonius - Common toad rush\n\n\n\n\n\nI love their rusty colored flowers, especially during the drier parts of the year when they begin to pop more due to the color contrast with the rest of their structure.\n\n\n2. Centromadia parryi ssp. australis - Southern tarplant\n\n\n\n\n\nI like how spiky tarplant is and its small yellow flowers. Also a California Rare Plant Rank: 1B.1 which I find pretty neat considering we have them on campus. Took this photo on 05/28/2025!\n\n\n3. Artemesia californica - California sagebrush\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m a big fan of the smell of sagebrush. It’s always a treat to run my hands through one to get smell their herbaceous scent."

    "text": "Using RStudio to Analyze Site Data for ENVS 153 Final Project\nThis quarter I took a class where our group was tasked with selecting a site in a natural area and gathering data from it throughout. Within a 1 meter plot in our site at Lagoon Island, we observed temperature, precipitation, the composition of the plant community, flower count, the composition of the bird community, insect counts, and pollinator counts at the same time every week over 8 weeks. We developed hypotheses of what we expected to see out of our data. One of which was that we predicted that flower count predicts pollinator count and that there is a positive linear relationship between the two variables. To describe the linear relationship between the two variables, I built a model using ordinary least squares, ran a Pearson’s r test, and visualized the model predictions.\nBased on our model predictions, pollinator count decreases by about 0.05 individuals for every 1 increase in flower count (linear regression, F1,6 = 0.25, P = 0.63). There is a weak negative linear relationship between flower count and pollinator count (Pearson’s r = 0.20). Based on our findings, we do not have evidence to reject the null hypothesis that flower count does not predict pollinator count. These results may be explained by our low sample size (n = 8), as we were only able to observe our site over 8 weeks.\nThe code is below:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) # loading packages\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(ggeffects)\ndata1 &lt;- read.csv(\"data/ES-153_Data.csv\") |&gt; # creating new object by reading in data\n  clean_names() # cleaning column names\n\n\nflower_model &lt;- lm(pollinator_count ~ flower_count, # building linear model where pollinator count is predicted by flower count\n                   data = data1) # setting data frame\nsummary(flower_model) # generating model summary\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = pollinator_count ~ flower_count, data = data1)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n -7.79  -4.53  -2.01   2.29  17.30 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.
