I used the leaflet package and built some code to display my hometown of Half Moon Bay on a map. The map was created for my "About Me" page.

```{r}
library(leaflet)

Map <- leaflet() |> 
  addTiles() |>   # add street map tiles
  addMarkers(lng=-122.4286, lat=37.4636, popup="Half Moon Bay") |> # add marker at Half Moon Bay
  setView(-119.4179, 36.7783, zoom = 5) # set map view and zoom
```
