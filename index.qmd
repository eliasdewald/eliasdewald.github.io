Hello! My name is Eli and I'm a 3rd year Environmental Studies student at the University of California Santa Barbara and student worker for the UCSB Cheadle
Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration. I enjoy doing restoration
work, working with plants, and learning and implementing strategies to ensure
the success of projects. Outside of work, I love surfing, hiking, cooking, and 
socializing. Check out the rest of my website to learn more about me!
