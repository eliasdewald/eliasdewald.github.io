Hello! My name is Eli and I'm a 3rd year Environmental Studies student at the University of California Santa Barbara and a student worker for the UCSB Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration. I enjoy doing restoration work, working with plants, and learning and implementing strategies to ensure the success of projects. Outside of work, I love surfing, hiking, cooking, socializing, and again, plants. Check out the rest of my website to learn more about me!
