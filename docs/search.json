    "text": "Hello! My name is Eli and I’m a 3rd year Environmental Studies student at the University of California Santa Barbara and a student worker for the UCSB Cheadle Center for Biodiversity and Ecological Restoration. I enjoy doing restoration work, working with plants, and learning and implementing strategies to ensure the success of projects. Outside of work, I love surfing, hiking, cooking, socializing, and again, plants. Check out the rest of my website to learn more about me!"

    "text": "Hometown - Half Moon Bay, CA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m from a small town about thirty minutes south of San Francisco called Half Moon Bay. It is a truly beautiful place as it is sandwiched between the Pacific Ocean on one side and the Santa Cruz mountains on the other side, so similar to how it is here in Santa Barbara. Growing up there cemented my love for the outdoors, especially the mountains and the sea.\n\n\nEducation\nI’m currently in the spring quarter of my 3rd year studying Environmental Studies at UCSB. I am pursuing a Bachelor’s of Science, so I’ve been taking many science classes during my time here. Of the sciences, ecology is the subject I’ve found most interesting. I specifically enjoy topics like ecological restoration and management, as well as community ecology, plant ecology, and fire ecology. Additionally, I’ve liked learning how to use tools like RStudio and ArcGIS Pro to help analyze and visualize data within these fields.\n\n\nFavorite Plants\nOver the past few years, I’ve really grown to appreciate the plants around me. I’ve always liked plants, but I enjoy being in there company more now. I also have a few local favorites.\n\n1. Juncus bufonius - Common toad rush\n\n\n\n\n\nI love their rusty colored flowers, especially during the drier parts of the year when they begin to pop more due to the color contrast with the rest of their structure.\n\n\n2. Centromadia parryi ssp. australis - Southern tarplant\n\n\n\n\n\nI like how spiky tarplant is and its small yellow flowers. Also a California Rare Plant Rank: 1B.1 which I find pretty neat considering we have them on campus. Took this photo on 05/28/2025!\n\n\n3. Artemesia californica - California sagebrush\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m a big fan of the smell of sagebrush. It’s always a treat to run my hands through one to get smell their herbaceous scent."
