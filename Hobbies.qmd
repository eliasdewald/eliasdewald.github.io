Surfing is a big part of the culture of Half Moon Bay, where I grew up. I'm blessed enough to be able to partake in it and have been surfing for years.

Nature has always been a big part of my life, and hiking has been a great way for me to spend more time within it. Trails that incorporate scrambling across boulders and rock faces are my favorite.

Cooking is one of my favorite hobbies, and I would like to consider it a talent. I love preparing food for my friends and family, I love experimenting and eyeballing, and I've found a lot of success with both. I am working on my presentation skills, but I think I have the flavor down for many dishes.
